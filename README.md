# PAB Vision
An AI assistant for the visually impaired integrates modules for friend detection, currency recognition, and image-to-text conversion into one single product. The distributed camera feed enables real-time processing of visual information. Voice commands serve as the primary interaction method for the visually impaired user. A specialized deep learning model has been trained for Indian currency recognition, providing accurate denomination counting. The friend detection module employs computer vision techniques, while the image-to-text conversion module relies on OCR algorithms for high-precision text extraction.
